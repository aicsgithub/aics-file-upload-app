// In our case, Axios was using Node's `http` module. Due to this, network
// requests were not visible in the "Network" tab of the Chromium dev tools,
// because the requests were happening in the Node layer, rather than the
// Chromium layer. Additionally, we had seen cases for many months where the app
// would hang after making network requests. This issue completely disappears
// when using the `XMLHttpRequest` adapter. This may be due to some unresolved
// issues with Electron and/or Node running on
// Linux (https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/10570).
